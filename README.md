## Deploying Your Site

The easiest way to deploy a Gatsby website to production is to use Gatsby Cloud from the Gatsby team. Gatsby Cloud is a platform that gives your Gatsby website superpowers! With intelligent caching and incremental builds, Gatsby Cloud takes the speed and performance of your Gatsby website to another level.

## Notes

### How to Register Page Modules

1. To create a new Page Module, create a new React component within the `/src/components/agility-pageModules` directory.
2. Make sure the name of your React component matches the name of the Page Module you created in Agility, i.e. If you have a Page Module named "Featured Post", your React component should be named `FeaturedPost.jsx`.

### How to Register Page Templates

1. To create a new Page Template, create a new React component within the `/src/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory.
2. Make sure the name of your React component matches the name of the Page Template you created in Agility, i.e. If you have a Page Template named "Main Template", your React component should be named `MainTemplate.jsx`.

### How to Properly Link to an Internal Page

To link to internal pages, use the `Link` component from gatsby.

```
import { Link } from 'gatsby';

// where post.path is the url path 
<Link to={post.path}>
  {post.title}
</Link>
```

### How to Resolve Linked Content

While you are sourcing and querying content in Gatsby, you are likely to come across a scenario where you need to retrieve a content item and its related content. In Agility CMS, Linked Content fields are used to related content to one another in various ways.

When querying a Post, for example, you may want to also retrieve the details for the Category. On your Post GraphQL node, you may notice a category property, however, it will only contain a contentid reference, not the entire node representing the Category.

You'll need to resolve this Linked Content when you need it using resolvers in the `gatsby-node.js` file.

### How to Preview Content

Previewing content prior to publishing is crucial for Editors. We can set up and configure Previews to work with Gatsby Cloud so editors can preview content as their making edits within Agility CMS.
